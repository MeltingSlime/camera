Scene:
A house in the desert.

Change:
I almost changed everything I built from the last time. Last time was a tree in the hole, but I feel like that needs more polishing.





1. Use at least 4 out of the 5 following types:

Point Light (MoonbodyLight, lamp(above top part))

Directional Light (SourceLight/Sun)

Spotlight (Rooflight)

Area Light (light around the outside of the housing)

Emissive Material (Orange light, lava particals, lamp top light, wall light)


2. Create a lighting transition 

Day-to-night cycle


3. Add a particle system 

3D Mesh emitter (Lava)


4. "Polished" look 

Cohesive scene: A house in the desert.

Interesting lighting:   some postprocessing, baking lightmap for static light, add realtime lightmap for lava and dynamic light

Good use of materials/textures:    wall, floor, terrain, and moon
